**Note:** Google Chrome's Developer tools now include a much better responsive tester, in particular one which works over HTTPS and websites with the X-Frame-Options header set to DENY. You may still use this code, but it is no longer supported.

You can find Chrome's responsive tester on the Developer tools toolbar:
